# FDA_GIFs

A few GIFs made for FDA inspections data and network analysis

`makeGIF.R` creates a number of png maps using `ggplot` of FDA retail inspections and violations over the last few years in Washington, California and Florida.

`WattsStrogatz.R` creates some network graphics using `iGraph` for the Erdos-Renyi and Watts-Strogatz networks with varying `p` values.

I then created a GIF using the resulting images at http://gifcreator.me/
